    "Multiprocessing in Python is a built-in package that allows the system to run multiple processes simultaneously. \n",
    "It will enable the breaking of applications into smaller threads that can run independently. \n",

    "thus improving the overall performance and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "In multiprocessing, the system can divide and assign tasks to different processors.\n",

    "The Python multiprocessing module provides multiple classes that allow us to build parallel programs to implement multiprocessing in Python.\n",
    "It offers an easy-to-use API for dividing processes between many processors, thereby fully leveraging multiprocessing.\n",
