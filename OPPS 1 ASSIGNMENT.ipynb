    "Four Pillars of OOPs  in Python \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Inheritance\n",
    "In Python it is possible to create an object that inherits the methods and properties of another object. \n",
    "This is called inheritance. In inheritance, there is a parent class and a child class. \n",
    "A child class inherits the properties and methods of the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Polymorphism\n",
    "Polymorphism simply means 'many forms'. In Python this means that you can have one function or object that can be used in different ways.\n",
    "Let's take an example of the addition operator (+); we can use it to add numbers, but we can also use it to concatenate strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Encapsulation\n",
    "Encapsulation is the process of making data private by wrapping data and its methods in a 'capsule' or unit, \n",
    "so that it can not be accessed or modified outside of that unit. This is achieved by making variables inside a class private.\n",
    "In Python we can make variables private by prefixing the variable name with a double underscore '__'. \n",
    " \n",
    "when we try to access the variable outside the function we get an attribute error because the variable is now private,\n",
    "and cannot be modified or changed from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Abstraction\n",
    "Abstraction is about keeping the process simple by hiding unnecessary details from the user. This reduces the complexity of the code, and ensures that \n",
    "we only concentrate on what is important.\n",
    "In OOP abstraction is achieved by creating an interface class (base class) and implementation classes (subclasses)\n",

    "he task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the class is created.\n",
    "Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at the time of Object creation. \n",
